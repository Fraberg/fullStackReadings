  - state and props

    - [see differences](https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props)
    - state: value defined by the component itself, to start with. Optional, preferable without (too many <=> + complexity and - predictability)
    - props - properties: value received from parent component, immutable for "pure" component. Like function argument
  - web page design with components tree
    - components tree design and hierarchy https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html
